# Software Engineering 2 - Agile Processes

## 1. Process Paradigms

### 1.1 Sequential and Iterative Processes

- **Code and Fix**
  - Simplest approach: code, test, fix until it works
  - Advantages: Quick start, rapid prototype
  - Disadvantages: Unplannable, difficult to distribute work, poor structure

- **Waterfall Model**
  - Sequential phases: Requirements, Design, Implementation, Verification, Maintenance
  - Advantages: Clear requirements, simple structure
  - Disadvantages: Late detection of issues, inflexible to changes

- **V-Model**
  - Extension of Waterfall, with testing phases corresponding to development phases
  - Example: Requirements phase paired with Acceptance Testing phase

- **Iterative Models**
  - Repeated cycles of development
  - Example: Spiral Model - risk assessment before each phase

### 1.2 Plan-Driven vs. Agile Processes

| Aspect | Plan-Driven | Agile |
|--------|-------------|-------|
| Approach | Linear or iterative | Always iterative |
| Planning | Detailed upfront | Adaptive |
| Changes | Possible | Welcomed |
| User Involvement | At milestones | Continuous |

## 2. Agile Processes

### 2.1 Agile Manifesto

- Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
- Working software over comprehensive documentation
- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
- Responding to change over following a plan

### 2.2 Scrum

- **Roles**
  - Product Owner: Manages product backlog
  - Scrum Master: Ensures process is followed
  - Development Team: Self-organizing, cross-functional

- **Artifacts**
  - Product Backlog: Prioritized list of features
  - Sprint Backlog: Tasks for current sprint
  - Increment: Potentially shippable product at sprint end

- **Events**
  - Sprint Planning: Plan work for the sprint
  - Daily Scrum: 15-minute sync meeting
  - Sprint Review: Demonstrate increment to stakeholders
  - Sprint Retrospective: Team reflection and improvement

- **Example Sprint**:
  - 2-week sprint
  - Sprint Planning (4 hours)
  - Daily Scrums (15 minutes each)
  - Sprint Review (2 hours)
  - Sprint Retrospective (1.5 hours)

### 2.3 User Stories

- Format: "As a [role], I want [goal/desire] so that [benefit]"
- Example: "As an administrator, I want access to a dashboard to manage user accounts."

### 2.4 Extreme Programming (XP)

- **Values**: Communication, Simplicity, Feedback, Courage, Respect
- **Practices**:
  - Pair Programming: Two developers work together
  - Test-Driven Development: Write tests before code
  - Continuous Integration: Integrate and test code frequently
  - Refactoring: Improve code structure without changing functionality

## 3. Comparing Process Models

- **Waterfall**: Suitable for projects with stable, well-understood requirements
- **V-Model**: Emphasizes verification and validation, good for critical systems
- **Spiral Model**: Focuses on risk management, suitable for large, high-risk projects
- **Scrum**: Adaptive, ideal for projects with changing requirements or unclear solutions
- **XP**: Emphasizes technical excellence and rapid feedback, good for smaller teams

## 4. Best Practices

- Choose the process model based on project characteristics and team expertise
- Adapt processes as needed, but maintain core principles
- Focus on delivering value to the customer regularly
- Encourage open communication and collaboration within the team and with stakeholders
- Continuously improve processes through regular retrospectives
